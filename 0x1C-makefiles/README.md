## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with Makefiles, which are used to specify how to compile and link a program. Makefiles contain rules to build each component of a project, along with dependencies to ensure that only the necessary components are rebuilt when source files change. By understanding and effectively utilizing Makefiles, developers can streamline their workflow and manage complex projects more efficiently.

## Requirements

To use this project, you need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Make utility

## Usage
